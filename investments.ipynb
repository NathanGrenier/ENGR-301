    "# 1. Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible investment opportunities that need to be evaluated before a successful strategy can be devised:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Housing Market Investments\n",
    "2. Stock Market Investments\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Investment in the Housing Market\n",
    "\n",
    "An investment in the housing market requires a large sum of money upfront. This is due to the 5% downpayment requirement and upfront fees such as Notary fees ($1500), the realtor's commission (5% of sale price), and the Welcome tax ($5000). This high initial cost ($6500 minimum) alongside the fact that we only start with $1000 means that we won't be eligible to buy a house from the start. Therefore, We will need to use the other investment opportunity, the stock market, to make enough money to even consider buying a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the potential return from an investment in housing, we can see from figure 1 that the highest return we could make (assuming we buy immediately) is a mere 200%. This return in outmatched by some of the stock options due to their higher volatility which can be taken advantage of.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"plots/part1/HPI_over_time.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "  <figcaption>Figure 1. Lowest and Highest HPI Values over Time</figcaption>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a benefit to owning a house. Once purchased, a house grants $1000/month in savings. This annuity could be used to increase the total amount of capital we invest in either market. What's important to note is that simply adding more money in the market isn't guaranteed to result in a greater overall gain. There is an opportunity cost of when you invest that needs to be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Investment in the Stock Market\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have access to the historical price data of each stock, a unique opportunity presents itself. There isn't a need to speculate what the future price of any asset will be. This means that every investment will be a perfect trade. Due to every trade being perfect, stock with the most price volatility will result in the highest returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the best investment strategy would be to buy and sell every dip and peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is one consideration to make. Certain commodities have fees associated with their trades. This means that an otherwise highly profitable stock can turn sour if high enough fees are present. In order to guarantee a profitable trade, these fees will have to be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details about the trading algorithms present in the simulation are discussed in [section 2.3](#23-create-the-trading-model).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Which is Better, Only Investing in the Stock Market or Dabbling in Both?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stock Market Investments Only\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only invest in the stock market, we can expect smaller individual returns that compound with themselves. Due to this compounding nature, our balance would experience exponential growth. This means that investing earlier is of the utmost importance. Making one or two more trades in the allotted period can result in a huge difference in our final balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stock Market and Housing Market Investments\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we can only purchase a house after making a minimum of roughly $6500 (6.5 times our original amount), an opportunity cost will be incurred. Buying a house uses all of our existing capital, negating the gains we made with our stock market investments up to the point of purchase. This lowers the total amount of returns we can make in the stock market for the remaining period of time. The upside is that we get $1000/month to invest in the stock market and that we make around a 200% return on the price of the house. However, this flat, or in other words linear, annuity and low rate of return won't make up for the time lost due to buying a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, investing only in the stock market seems like the better alternative due to it's compounding nature and the fact that buying a house incurs a large opportunity cost.\n"
